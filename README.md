# Inventory Management System

## Overview

This inventory management system was developed for stock tracking for a business. The application uses a simple text file to store part numbers and relevant information, displayed in a user-friendly data grid. I kept the UI basic.

## Features

- **Part Number Tracking:** Easily manage and track part numbers.
- **Invoice Generation:** Can easily create an invoice with the chosen parts with little user input
- **Invoice Number:** Generates a new invoice number to easily keep track of the files
- **Automatic Price calculation:** Adds up total based off parts picked and how many used along with hours chosen.
- **Basic UI:** Simple user interface for quick access.

## How to Use

- Open Inventory.txt file, delete the sample data and input your own information as you please in the same format as the sample data.
